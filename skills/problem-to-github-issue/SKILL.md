# Turn evidence into a GitHub issue

An issue preserves the problem, verified evidence, and maintainer decisions. It may remain
exploratory. A separate agent brief makes settled work executable.

Read [the issue contract](references/issue-contract.md) before any governed lifecycle mutation,
including closing an issue as duplicate or obsolete.

## Investigate before drafting

1. Read applicable root and scoped `AGENTS.md` files and the original maintainer request, including
   subsequent explicit decisions. Compare the reported problem and every proposed requirement with
   them before choosing a solution. Follow the authority check in the issue contract.
2. Inspect accessible application state, logs, persisted records, source paths, and recent changes.
3. Reproduce the problem when practical. Record the smallest honest reproduction.
4. Trace the affected path through its callers and inspect sibling paths that enforce the same
   contract. Do this before proposing a fix.
5. Search open and closed issues for the same desired outcome and root-cause boundary.
6. Build an evidence ledger. Classify each material statement as a reported observation, verified
   evidence, a diagnostic limit, a hypothesis, a potential systemic gap, an option, an unknown, or
   an approved decision.
7. Ask the maintainer when an unresolved choice would change product behavior, architecture,
   policy, or a quantitative limit.

When the evidence supports a correction, ask for one fix at the shared boundary and one focused
regression that exercises it. Do not prescribe a local patch or a refactor that the traced paths do
not justify.

Finish investigation when every material statement has a ledger classification and every
remaining limit names the evidence that would resolve it.

## Draft the issue

- Follow the repository's language convention. Use English when no convention exists.
- Use the smallest set of contract sections that carries the available information.
- Keep hypotheses and unapproved options out of desired behavior and acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance criteria restate the requested or approved outcome in observable terms. The agent
  does not decide additional requirements. Omit a separate criteria list when the clear outcome
  already supplies the completion condition; do not pad the issue with plausible improvements.
- Preserve missing evidence as a diagnostic limit. Do not fill the gap with a plausible cause.
- Describe observable behavior. Use code paths only as evidence, not as a brittle implementation
  plan.
- Keep unrelated warnings and adjacent improvement ideas out of the issue.

Before submitting, compare the draft with the evidence ledger, applicable `AGENTS.md`, and the
maintainer's request. Every factual claim and requirement must trace to its permitted source class.
Repeat this check when editing, reopening, or preparing an existing issue for implementation;
an existing issue is not proof that its requirements were approved.

## Respect the lifecycle

New issues start as triage records. Add a `ready-for-agent` label and an `Agent brief` only after the
maintainer approves that transition, all blocking decisions are settled, and all blocking
dependencies are resolved.

After editing or reopening a ready issue, revalidate it against the readiness contract. Remove the
`ready-for-agent` label whenever it no longer meets that contract, and restore it only after the
maintainer approves the updated brief.

The agent brief is the autonomous implementation contract. It describes behavior, boundaries,
dependencies, and verification. It does not silently answer open questions from the issue.

## Mutate GitHub only with authorization

Drafting and searching are read-only. Immediately before creating, editing, labeling, commenting
on, closing, or reopening an issue, confirm that the current request authorizes that mutation.

Use an authenticated GitHub connector or `gh` for private data and mutations. If neither is
available, return the draft and the exact blocked action. Do not substitute web search for private
repository access.
