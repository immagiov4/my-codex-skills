# GLOSSARY.md Format

## Resolve the project glossary

Use the glossary path declared by repository instructions or `docs/agents/domain.md`. Otherwise, continue the existing `GLOSSARY.md` / `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` or `CONTEXT.md` / `CONTEXT-MAP.md` layout, following the map to each relevant context. If both layouts exist without an authoritative pointer, ask which owns the vocabulary before editing. When neither exists, use `GLOSSARY.md` for new glossary material and create it only when the first term is resolved. Preserve existing filenames and keep one authoritative glossary per context.

The examples below use the new names; the same format applies to an existing `CONTEXT.md` layout.

## Structure

```md
# {Context Name}

{One or two sentence description of what this context is and why it exists.}

## Language

**Order**:
{A one or two sentence description of the term}
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction

**Invoice**:
A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery.
_Avoid_: Bill, payment request

**Customer**:
A person or organization that places orders.
_Avoid_: Client, buyer, account
```

## Rules

- **Be opinionated.** When multiple words exist for the same concept, pick the best one and list the others under `_Avoid_`.
- **Keep definitions tight.** One or two sentences max. Define what it IS, not what it does.
- **Only include terms specific to this project's context.** General programming concepts (timeouts, error types, utility patterns) don't belong even if the project uses them extensively. Before adding a term, ask: is this a concept unique to this context, or a general programming concept? Only the former belongs.
- **Group terms under subheadings** when natural clusters emerge. If all terms belong to a single cohesive area, a flat list is fine.

## Single vs multi-context repos

**Single context (most repos):** One `GLOSSARY.md` at the repo root.

**Multiple contexts:** A `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` at the repo root lists the contexts, where they live, and how they relate to each other:

```md
# Glossary Map

## Contexts

- [Ordering](./src/ordering/GLOSSARY.md): receives and tracks customer orders
- [Billing](./src/billing/GLOSSARY.md): generates invoices and processes payments
- [Fulfillment](./src/fulfillment/GLOSSARY.md): manages warehouse picking and shipping

## Relationships

- **Ordering → Fulfillment**: Ordering emits `OrderPlaced` events; Fulfillment consumes them to start picking
- **Fulfillment → Billing**: Fulfillment emits `ShipmentDispatched` events; Billing consumes them to generate invoices
- **Ordering ↔ Billing**: Shared types for `CustomerId` and `Money`
```

Use the layout selected by the [resolution rules](#resolve-the-project-glossary): a map identifies multiple contexts; a root glossary without a map identifies a single context.

When multiple contexts exist, infer which one the current topic relates to. If unclear, ask.
